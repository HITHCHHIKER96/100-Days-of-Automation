## 🔥 Non-Negotiable Rules
1. **No new technology for 120 days** — Python + Playwright + API only
2. **GitHub commit every single day** — one line still counts
3. **Never miss two days in a row** — miss one, fine. Two, the habit breaks
4. **Type every line yourself** — no copy-paste from tutorials
5. **Apply from Day 111 even if not ready** — especially if not ready
